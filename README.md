# Sift

## General information

Sift is a telegram notification system that sends you a message whenever certain telegram channels/groups mentions your keyword of interest.

This is a personal project to solve a first-world problem; There are plenty of curators on telegram channels/groups that post good (food, travel etc) deals daily, yet reading through these messages to look for specific deals take too much time. I developed this application that takes in a list of user input keywords and if it matches any messages, it sends a notification to the subscriber.
